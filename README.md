# OctoPrint-OctoRant 1.2.3

OctoRant is a plugin allowing Octoprint to send notifications to a Discord channel via a webhook URL. When wanted it can directly send a snapshot to Discord (without needing third-party services)

## OctoRant is only a notifier!

OctoRant is *one-way only*, from your printer to your Discord channel. This plugin **is not able** to receive commands for your printer from Discord. However a good fellow @cameroncros forked my plugin exactly to add this feature. Feel free to try [DiscordRemote](https://plugins.octoprint.org/plugins/DiscordRemote/)

## Setup

### Install the plugin

Install via the bundled [Plugin Manager](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/wiki/Plugin:-Plugin-Manager)
or manually using this URL:

    https://github.com/bchanudet/OctoPrint-Octorant/archive/master.zip

### Create the WebHook in Discord

*Note : you need to have the permission "Manage WebHooks" to create or edit a WebHook in Discord.*

![Go to the channel settings](assets/docs/discord_setup_1.jpg)

![Under "Webhooks", click "Create Webhook"](assets/docs/discord_setup_2.jpg)

![Enter the details, and copy the URL at the bottom](assets/docs/discord_setup_3.jpg)

Once you got the WebHook URL, head over to the plugin configuration to finish the setup.

## Configuration

The plugin can be configured in the configuration panel, under the "Octorant" panel.

### Discord Settings

- WebHook URL : please follow the Setup procedure to retrieve the URL of the WebHook.
- Bot name : You can override the name you put on the WebHook description in Discord by a name. Useful if the webhook is not specific to Octorant and also used for other things.
- Bot Avatar URL : You can also override the avatar us put in Discord for the WebHook. The URL needs to be globally accessible (it will be retrieved by Discord's servers).

In order for you to be sure these settings work, every time you change one of them, a test message will be sent to the corresponding Discord Channel. If you don't receive it, something is most likely wrong!

### Message Settings

Here you can customize every message handled by Octorant.

- **Toggle the message** : by unchecking the checkbox in front of the message title, you can disable the message. It won't be sent to Discord.
- **Message** : you can change the default content here. See the section [Message format](#message-format) for more information.
- **Include snapshot** : if you have a snapshot URL defined in the Octoprint settings, you can choose to upload a snapshot with the message to Discord. 
- **Notify every `XX`%** : specific to the `printing progress` message, this settings allows you to change the frequency of the notification : 
    - `10%` means you'll receive a message at 10%, 20%, 30%, 40% ... 80%, 90% of the printing process.
    - `5%` means you'll receive a message at 5%, 10%, 15%, 20% ... 80%, 85%, 90%, 95% of the printing process.
    - etc...

### Scripts Settings

Octorant allows you to launch scripts everytime a message is sent:

- Before sending: perfect for turning some LED on to ensure the webcam will always have enough light when taking the snapshot
- After sending: perfect for turning the same LED off :)

Script configuration was made voluntarily a little harder, as running scripts exposes much more the host computer. You can find more indications on the [wiki](https://github.com/bchanudet/OctoPrint-Octorant/wiki/Launching-scripts)


## Message format

Messages are regular Discord messages, which means you can use :
- `**markdown**` format (see [Discord Documentation](https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/210298617-Markdown-Text-101-Chat-Formatting-Bold-Italic-Underline-))
- `:emoji:` shortcuts to display emojis
- `<@!#################>` to notify someone with a Discord unique ID
  - The unique ID can be found by typing `\@yourhandle#1234` into a Discord channel
  - Per [this comment from](https://github.com/bchanudet/OctoPrint-Octorant/issues/43#issuecomment-634155718) [KipLandwehr](https://github.com/KipLandwehr)
