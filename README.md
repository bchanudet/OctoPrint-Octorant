### Create the Discord Bot  in Discord
TODO: XXX

## Configuration

The plugin can be configured in the configuration panel, under the "DiscordRemote" panel.

### Discord Settings

- Bot Token: The token for a discord bot.
- Channel ID: The ID of a channel the bot will listen and post to. Ensure that this is locked down so that strangers cannot send commands to your printer.

In order for you to be sure these settings work, every time you change one of them, a test message will be sent to the corresponding Discord Channel. If you don't receive it, something is most likely wrong!

### Message Settings

Here you can customize every message handled by DiscordRemote.

- **Toggle the message** : by unchecking the checkbox in front of the message title, you can disable the message. It won't be sent to Discord.
- **Message** : you can change the default content here. See the section [Message format](#message-format) for more information.
- **Include snapshot** : if you have a snapshot URL defined in the Octoprint settings, you can choose to upload a snapshot with the message to Discord.
- **Notify every `XX`%** : specific to the `printing progress` message, this settings allows you to change the frequency of the notification :
    - `10%` means you'll receive a message at 10%, 20%, 30%, 40% ... 80%, 90% of the printing process.
    - `5%` means you'll receive a message at 5%, 10%, 15%, 20% ... 80%, 85%, 90%, 95% of the printing process.
    - etc...


## Message format

Messages are regular Discord messages, which means you can use :
- `**markdown**` format (see [Discord Documentation](https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/210298617-Markdown-Text-101-Chat-Formatting-Bold-Italic-Underline-))
- `:emoji:` shortcuts to display emojis
- `@mentions` to notify someone

Some events also support variables, here is a basic list :

**Printing process : started event** :
- `{name}` : file's name that's being printed
- `{path}` : file's path within its origin location
- `{origin}` : the origin storage location

**Printing process : failed event** :

- `{origin}` : the origin storage location
- `{time}`: time needed for the print (in seconds)
- `{time_formatted}` : same as `{time}`, but in a human-readable format (`HH:MM:SS`)

**Printing process : failed event** :
